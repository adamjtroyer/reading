"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 10","","Productivity is not what will bring purpose to your life, but what will enable you to excel in living out your existing purpose."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 11","","The simple fact is, you are not the point of your life. You are not the star of your show. If you live for yourself, your own comfort, your own glory, your own fame, you will miss out on your very purpose. God created you to bring glory to him. Q2. How can you glorify God in your day-to-day"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","The Bible assures you that good works are any deeds that are done for the benefit of other people and the glory of God. You are already"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","Good works, then, are any and all of those deeds you do for the benefit of others."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 13","","with consideration to your clients and coworkers, you are doing good works that bring glory to God, because you are living outside yourself, doing what benefits the people in your life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 16","","The Bible is clear: At every time and in every context you are able to do good to others, and so you should do good to others."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 16","","Q6. What is productivity? A. Productivity is effectively stewarding my gifts, talents, time, energy, and enthusiasm for the good of others and the glory of God."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 19","","three productivity thieves: laziness, busyness, and the mean combination of thorns and thistles."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 21","","Busyness may make you feel good about yourself and give the illusion of getting things done, but it probably just means that you are directing too little attention in too many directions, that you are prioritizing all the wrong things, and that your productivity is suffering."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 23","","the absence of productivity or the presence of woefully diminished productivity is first a theological problem. It is a failure to understand or apply the truths God reveals in the Bible. Do"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 24","","your good deeds, and the more they will glorify God. You have the choice before you each day. This truth means that productivity is not just about what you do in the workplace. It is not just about your success in the one task that consumes the greatest part of your time and attention each week. It is about all of life. It is about your personal life, your family life, your church life, and everything else."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 36","","Many productivity gurus tell you that you need to have a personalized big-picture mission statement to encompass all of life and every area of responsibility. Personally, that both intimidates and paralyzes me, and I have never been successful at it. But what I have found very helpful is preparing a limited mission statement for each of my areas of responsibility. I have five areas of responsibility, and for that reason have five mission statements."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 39","","Your primary pursuit in productivity is not doing more things, but doing more good."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 49","","This principle extends to any area of life but is especially helpful in organizing your productivity system. Here it is: a home for everything, and like goes with like."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 81","","you need to build a life of productivity—of doing good to others. And to do this work, you will need a system. A productivity system is a set of methods, habits, and routines that enable you to be most effective in knowing what to do and in actually doing it. An effective system involves identifying, deploying, and relying on appropriate tools. When functioning together, these tools enable you to operate smoothly and efficiently, dedicating appropriate time and attention to the most important tasks."
