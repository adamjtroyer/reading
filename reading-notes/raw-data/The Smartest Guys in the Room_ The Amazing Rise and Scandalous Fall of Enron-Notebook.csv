"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 465","","The tale of Enron is a story of human weakness, of hubris and greed and rampant self-delusion; of ambition run amok; of a grand experiment in the deregulated world; of a business model that didn’t work; and of smart people who believed their next gamble would cover their last disaster—and who couldn’t admit they were wrong. In less combative moods, Skilling"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 794","","Although it took place a long time ago, it seems obvious now that the Enron Oil scandal was the canary in the coal mine."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1054","","Skilling they don’t just use the word “smart”; they use phrases like “incandescently brilliant” or “the smartest person I ever met.” Skilling in the late 1980s wasn’t a physically striking man—he was smallish, a little pudgy, and balding—but his mental agility was breathtaking. He could process information and conceptualize new ideas with blazing speed. He could instantly simplify highly complex issues into a sparkling, compelling image. And he presented his ideas with a certainty that bordered on arrogance and brooked no dissent. He used"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1060","","For all his brilliance, Skilling had dangerous blind spots. His management skills were appalling, in large part because he didn’t really understand people. He expected people to behave according to the imperatives of pure intellectual logic, but of course nobody does that (including, it should be said, Skilling himself)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1064","","Skilling also had a tendency to oversimplify, and he largely disregarded—indeed, he had an active distaste for—the messy details involved in executing a plan. What thrilled Skilling, always, was the intellectual purity of an idea, not the translation of that idea into reality."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1067","","Over time his arrogance hardened, and he became so sure that he was the smartest guy in the room that anyone who disagreed with him was summarily dismissed as just not bright enough to “get it.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1068","","And there was one other thing about Skilling. For all his analytical abilities, he was a gambler at heart and had been from an early age. He always assumed that he could beat the odds. In the end, that was Skilling’s most dangerous blind spot of all."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1152","","But like Skilling himself, McKinsey partners tend to be designers of ditches, not diggers of ditches. When it comes to executing their lofty theories, well, consultants lean toward leaving those messy realities to the companies themselves."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1169","","McKinsey has since sought to distance itself from Skilling and Enron, much of what he brought to Enron—not only ideas about how to reshape the natural gas industry but ideas about what companies should value and how they should be run—came out of his experience at McKinsey."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1213","","In classic Skilling fashion, he used just one slide in his presentation—which shocked the Enron executives, who were expecting dozens—and he spoke for less than a half hour. When he had finished, an executive named Jim Rogers declared the idea dumb, and virtually all of the others agreed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1657","","it all sounded very Darwinian, well, that was the point. Skilling believed that greed was the greatest motivator, and he was only too happy to feed it. “I’ve thought about this a lot, and all that matters is money,” Terry Thorn, an Enron managing director, recalls Skilling telling him. “You buy loyalty with money. This touchy-feely stuff isn’t as important as cash. That’s what drives performance.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1669","","Which offers up the problem: no company can prosper over the long term if every employee is a free agent, motivated solely by greed, no matter how smart he is. No company can function if it only hires brilliant MBAs—and sets them against each other. There is a reason companies value team players, just as there’s a reason that people who get along with others tend to do well in corporate life. The reason is simple: you can’t build a company on brilliance alone. You need people who can come up with ideas, and you also need people who can implement those ideas and are well compensated for doing so. The pure meritocracy Skilling thought"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2154","","Then there was the question of what happened to the large sums spent on projects that didn’t go forward. Here was an early example of Enron’s willingness to stretch accounting rules. The money Enron poured into projects that never were built—and such a failed deal could soak up tens of millions—was supposed to be written off. In Vietnam, for instance, one accountant says that Enron spent some $18 million trying to build a power plant, only to see the project canceled. Yet Enron International often booked such costs as an asset on the balance sheet, in what came to be known around the company as “the snowball.” Usually the rationale was that there was no official letter saying the project was dead, so therefore, officially, it wasn’t. Rich Kinder had a rule: the snowball had to stay under $90 million. But it eventually ballooned to over $200 million."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2177","","But the most poisonous explanation for the mad rush to do deals was money, not the money Enron would make but the money the developers would make. What one former international executive calls the “fatal flaw” in the business was the compensation structure. Developers got bonuses on a project-by-project basis. The developers would calculate the present value of all the expected future cash flow from a project."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2181","","No wonder the developers were so eager to move on to the next deal; they had no financial incentive to follow through on the one they’d just completed. And the money they stood to make was stunning, amounting to some 9 percent of the project’s total value. In other words, if the developers estimated that the project would ultimately bring Enron $100 million, the developers took home $9 million. In a sense, they were paid on the basis of mark-to-market accounting—just like the traders in Skilling’s group. It was crazy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3369","","That statement in Enron’s risk-management manual perfectly captured the sentiment of the times. In fact, the material in the manual, developed with the help of a consulting firm, was used throughout the energy-trading industry."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3566","","“Any company worth its salt uses accounting rules to smooth small peaks and valleys,” says one former Enron accountant. “But with Enron, it got to a point where it was so prolific.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3586","","Here’s how another former employee describes the process: “Say you have a dog, but you need to create a duck on the financial statements. Fortunately, there are specific accounting rules for what constitutes a duck: yellow feet, white covering, orange beak. So you take the dog and paint its feet yellow and its fur white and you paste an orange plastic beak on its nose, and then you say to your accountants, ‘This is a duck! Don’t you agree that it’s a duck?’ And the accountants say, ‘Yes, according to the rules, this is a duck.’ Everybody knows that it’s a dog, not a duck, but that doesn’t matter, because you’ve met the rules for calling it a duck.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3926","","But if the companies themselves set up the SPEs, what exactly constituted independence? Amazingly, the rules developed by the accounting gurus stated that as long as 3 percent of the capital in the SPE came from an independent source and was truly at risk—meaning that it could all be lost if the deal went awry—the SPE qualified as independent. In other words, even if 97 percent of the capital consisted of debt raised by the company selling the assets, the company didn’t have to include that debt on its balance sheet."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3949","","At the time of its bankruptcy, Enron had over $2 billion in off-balance-sheet debt related solely to securitizations. While securitizations generated both cash and"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4001","","make sense: “The problem is, Enron did them on steroids.” Actually, the problem was that nobody inside Global Finance thought any of this was a problem. Though the company was piling up truly astounding levels of debt—by the end, Enron owed some $38 billion, of which only $13 billion was on its balance"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4005","","Instead, the Enron finance executives thought about how much smarter they were than everybody else in American business. They also convinced themselves and their accountants that they were complying with GAAP accounting, though the mental gymnastics required to get there were often tortured, to say the least. Indeed, they"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4108","","But despite the whispers—indeed, despite knowing far more than most people about what was really going on inside Enron—few bankers were willing to stop doing business with the company. They were hooked, too.  • "
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4433","","Despite Skilling’s oft-stated horror at the way Rebecca Mark’s international deal makers were paid, he instituted virtually the same system at EES. The EES originators—they eventually totaled 170—got huge bonuses not on the basis of how a deal worked out over time but on how profitable it appeared on the day the contract was signed. Margaret Ceconi,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4443","","Shockingly, Pai’s team was allowed to establish pricing curves that were different from the ones used by the wholesale traders. In other words, different parts of Enron were making different long-term pricing assumptions, then booking millions in mark-to-market profits based on those different guesses."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5231","","More than that, though, they believed that the market was the ultimate judge of their work and their worth. The market created a true meritocracy: you either made money because you made good trading decisions or you lost money because you made bad ones. Enron traders didn’t concern themselves with ethics or morality apart from the unyielding judgment of the markets. Maximizing profit was not inconsistent with doing good, they believed, but an inherent part of it, and the judge of good and bad was the immediate consequence of a split-second trade. The highest compliment a trader could pay a colleague was to call him intellectually pure. The worst insult was to accuse someone of making a deal that wasn’t economic."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5308","","“Jeff couldn’t let go of ‘we’re just a logistics company,’ because if you did, the stock was going to get nailed,” says a former senior originator. “People found it incredible, but we thought, more power to Jeff if he can sell it to the Street,” adds another former executive. Then he pauses. “But it was fundamentally misrepresenting the business to the people who own it: the stockholders.” The Enron board was also"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5495","","At Enron, it was bookable accounting profits, not dollars coming in the door, that mattered. “People did not know the difference between mark-to-market earnings and cash,” says a former trader. “No one ever talked to me about cash,”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5575","","Once upon a time, an analyst saw his job as trying to assess a company’s long-term prospects. The modern analyst, however, was more a marketer than a researcher and was almost entirely consumed by short-term considerations. Above all else, analysts focused on earnings per share. They regularly consulted with the company’s investor relations executives, who quietly gave them what came to be known as earnings guidance. Using that guidance, the analysts came up with their earnings estimates for the next quarter (or the next year), which they would then market to their big institutional clients."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5581","","The crucial point is this: so long as a company met or beat its earnings-per-share estimate, nothing else mattered. Cash didn’t matter. Off-balance-sheet debt didn’t matter. Even on-balance-sheet debt didn’t matter. And meeting or beating its quarterly estimates was exactly the game Enron had mastered. In the giddiness of the bull market, no analyst was going to spoil the party by asking tough questions about how it had pulled this"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5594","","Why were analysts so maniacally focused on quarterly earnings estimates? In large part, because that’s what many of their most important clients cared about. The bull market brought with it the rise of a new breed of institutional investor: momentum investors, who bought stocks primarily because they were rising and whose stock-picking discipline was built solely around whether a company beat its earnings-per-share"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5751","","It’s not as if Enron employees were laughing at the gullibility of the out- side world. Certainly there were executives who worried about the company’s financial maneuvers, but the vast majority of people who worked for Enron simply assumed that the Global Finance team and Enron’s accountants at Arthur Andersen—not to mention the stock analysts and credit analysts—knew what they were doing and that there was nothing for them to worry about."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 5807","","One outside public-relations consultant tried to ask Enron employees where they thought they were vulnerable. All he got in return were blank stares. People at Enron simply didn’t believe they were vulnerable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 8639","","The issue now was that Enron wanted to report these problems as nonrecurring charges, one-of-a-kind events that didn’t really reflect on the underlying performance of the company’s businesses. This too had big Wall Street implications. Analysts tended to discount nonrecurring charges and focus instead on operating earnings. For precisely that reason, the accounting treatment on this front was rife with opportunity for abuse. And Enron was a habitual abuser: historically, it had treated routine business losses as nonrecurring charges, and booked onetime gains as operating profits."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9172","","Enron was running out of options. Even after the new $1 billion loan from the banks—which still hadn’t closed—the big issue remained liquidity. No longer willing to trust Enron’s credit, more and more of the company’s trading counterparties were demanding cash collateral. Money was rushing out the door faster than Enron could raise it. By early"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9522","","The larger message was that the wealth and power enjoyed by those at the top of the heap in corporate America demand no sense of broader responsibility. To accept those arguments is to embrace the notion that ethical behavior requires nothing more than avoiding the explicitly illegal, that refusing to see the bad things happening in front of you makes you innocent, and that telling the truth is the same thing as making sure that no one can prove you lied."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9535","","Of course, this argument utterly ignores the larger truth, which is that those transactions added up to a completely illusory picture of Enron’s financial health, to which Andersen was also legally required to attest. History will record that Arthur Andersen, in the legal system’s judgment of its role at Enron, was ultimately found not guilty. But in any commonsense accounting of what happened, it surely was not innocent."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9559","","the right answer.” But, the investigators continued, “Duncan has discovered many facts that make him believe that Skilling did not keep the board fully informed. He cannot recall any discussions with Skilling that the company was encountering or was susceptible to any financial problems.” Another director privately put it this way: “The board was duped. I don’t see any other answer. These things could not have happened without Skilling being a part of it.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9933","","It came on October 23, 2006, when Judge Lake sentenced him to 24 years and four months in prison and a fine of $45 million. Skilling’s request to remain free while he appealed his conviction was denied. He reported to a low-security prison in Waseca, Minnesota, and began serving his sentence on December 13, 2006—with a projected release date of 2028, when he would be 74 years old."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 9995","","This time around, though, there were no prosecutions—none—of major executives. Even civil actions by the SEC were fairly limited; in many cases, like the Citigroup case, firms paid but weren’t required to admit guilt. If individuals were named, they were often painfully junior, as in the case the SEC brought against Goldman Sachs."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 10047","","Maybe it’s worth a different kind of comparison between Enron and the financial crisis. The difference between the way Enron executives behaved and the way highly paid people at so many of our financial firms behaved isn’t the difference between black and white. If it’s anything, it’s a shade of grey—the difference between a prosecutable lie and deliberately looking the other way, the difference between Enron’s illusory profits and the profits of many financial firms, which quickly turned into huge losses."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 10055","","Compare all that to the making of loans to people who couldn’t pay them back and the packaging of those loans into securities to be sold to clueless investors. The former was genuinely creative; the latter was simply opportunistic and destructive. Or to put it a different way, there was so much possibility in Enron, and there could have been a different ending. There was never going to be anything but a bad ending to the inflation of home prices. By some measures, maybe the Enron guys really were the smartest guys in the room."
