"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 174","","An apt joke was that other insurance industry CEOs excelled at golf and drinking—but Greenberg was never good at either. He has excelled in the insurance business."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 187","","AIG’s employees made the company’s culture distinctive. There were no employment contracts at AIG and compensation programs were long term, with most payoffs, which could be substantial, deferred until retirement. A large percentage of AIG employees held AIG stock, and most senior executives had virtually their entire net worth in AIG."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 516","","These steps would promote the cardinal principle Greenberg brought to the insurance"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 534","","In the meeting with Starr’s top executives, Greenberg reeled off other reforms he intended to make. At the top of the list was adding substantial reinsurance facilities. This refers to the practice of one insurance company buying policies from other insurance companies to recover part of the losses it suffers under its own policies. In addition to diversifying risk, it is sometimes cheaper to backstop insurance underwriting using reinsurance than to maintain capital to cover the losses, Greenberg explained. American Home needed reinsurance for its existing policies, moreover, simply because it was running out of capital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 708","","American Home was about to report a substantial profit in 1967. Good news, of course, but also incurring a large tax bill at a time when the company’s capital position still needed strengthening. Fortuitously, right at year-end, Greenberg got a call from Guy Carpenter, another legendary figure in the insurance industry whose name still graces the reinsurance firm he founded. Carpenter, with whom Greenberg developed a productive working relationship, reported an opportunity to acquire Transatlantic Company, which had a loss that, if acquired by year-end, would offset much of American Home’s profit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 808","","Executives continued to exhibit the traits that Starr prized and Greenberg sought out: fresh-thinking, self-reliant individuals prepared to make necessary changes and to be creative."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1123","","There was no single trait that Greenberg looked for but these employees tended to fit a model type that he called the “white blackbird.”1 These were individuals with an entrepreneurial conviction and a unique tenacity to forge profitable change. At work, they pioneered the development of desirable products in a demanding environment that was based on innovation, political astuteness, market awareness and technical discipline. This entrepreneurial spirit would define AIG’s culture."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1173","","People appreciated that insurance was a service that could not be patented, requiring constant invention, swift product introduction, and promotion, endlessly repeated. Creativity was ignited by paying close attention to trends and pockets of hazards where insurance was needed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1232","","Greenberg demonstrated passion and a belief that presence meant something. He set an example of being there, never “mailing it in,” so employees got the message that they could not mail it in either."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1254","","Like Dupperault, at least a dozen AIG executives went on to serve as CEOs of other major insurance companies. Given its size measured by employee numbers, that yield put AIG among the leading progenitors of CEOs in corporate America, rivaling the likes of larger companies such as General Electric and IBM.14 AIG alumni who became CEOs elsewhere include two of Greenberg’s sons, Jeffrey and Evan, who became CEO at Marsh & McLennan and ACE, respectively."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1653","","AIG executives habitually tried to anticipate world events and prepare to respond to them. Roberts tried to imagine what would happen if and when the Cold War ended. With this quest to “look around corners,” Roberts supervised a team of young colleagues to develop new business in eastern Europe, behind the Iron Curtain."
