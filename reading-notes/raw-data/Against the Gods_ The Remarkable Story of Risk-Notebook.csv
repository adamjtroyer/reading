"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 133","","The revolutionary idea that defines the boundary between modern times and the past is the mastery of risk: the notion that the future is more than a whim of the gods and that men and women are not passive before nature."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 137","","This book tells the story of a group of thinkers whose remarkable vision revealed how to put the future at the service of the present. By showing the world how to understand risk, measure it, and weigh its consequences, they converted risk-taking into one of the prime catalysts that drives modern Western society."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 146","","The ability to define what may happen in the future and to choose among alternatives lies at the heart of contemporary societies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 216","","All the tools we use today in risk management and in the analysis of decisions and choice, from the strict rationality of game theory to the challenges of chaos theory, stem from the developments that took place between 1654 and 1760, with only two exceptions:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 246","","Our lives teem with numbers, but we sometimes forget that numbers are only tools. They have no soul; they may indeed become fetishes. Many of our most critical decisions are made by computers, contraptions that devour numbers like voracious monsters and insist on being nourished with ever-greater quantities of digits to crunch, digest, and spew back."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 503","","The successful business executive is a forecaster first; purchasing, producing, marketing, pricing, and organizing all follow."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1039","","Probability has always carried this double meaning, one looking into the future, the other interpreting the past, one concerned with our opinions, the other concerned with what we actually know. The distinction will appear repeatedly throughout this book. In the first sense, probability means the degree of belief or approvability of an opinion—the gut view of probability. Scholars use the term “epistemological” to convey this meaning; epistemological refers to the limits of human knowledge not fully analyzable. This first concept of probability is much"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1500","","Pascal explained that belief in God is not a decision. You cannot awaken one morning and declare, “Today I think I will decide to believe in God.” You believe or you do not believe. The decision, therefore, is whether to choose to act in a manner that will lead to believing in God, like living with pious people and following a life of “holy water and sacraments.” The person who follows these precepts is wagering that God is. The person who cannot be bothered with that kind of thing is wagering that God is not. The only"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2273","","Once Bernoulli has established his basic thesis that people ascribe different values to risk, he introduces a pivotal idea: “[The] utility resulting from any small increase in wealth will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of goods previously possessed.” Then he observes, “Considering the nature of man, it seems to me that the foregoing hypothesis is apt to be valid for many people to whom this sort of comparison can be applied.” The hypothesis that utility is inversely related to the quantity of goods previously possessed is one of the great intellectual leaps in the history of ideas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2284","","For the first time in history Bernoulli is applying measurement to something that cannot be counted. He has acted as go-between in the wedding of intuition and measurement. Cardano, Pascal, and Fermat provided a method for figuring the risks in each throw of the dice, but Bernoulli introduces us to the risk-taker—the player who chooses how much to bet or whether to bet at all. While probability theory sets up the choices, Bernoulli defines the motivations of the person who does the choosing. This is an entirely new area of study and body of theory. Bernoulli laid the intellectual groundwork for much of what was to follow, not just in economics, but in theories about how people make decisions and choices in every aspect of life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2403","","The logical consequence of Bernoulli’s insight leads to a new and powerful intuition about taking risk. If the satisfaction to be derived from each successive increase in wealth is smaller than the satisfaction derived from the previous increase in wealth, then the disutility caused by a loss will always exceed the positive utility provided by a gain of equal size."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2626","","Jacob Bernoulli unwittingly defined the agenda for the remainder of this book. From this point forward, the debate over managing risk will converge on the uses of his three requisite assumptions—full information, independent trials, and the relevance of quantitative valuation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2650","","All the law tells us is that the average of a large number of throws will be more likely than the average of a small number of throws to differ from the true average by less than some stated amount."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2668","","“Probability,” he declares, “is degree of certainty and differs from absolute certainty as the part differs from the whole.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2778","","One hundred percent perfection is a practical impossibility in most instances—the world as we know it seems to have an incurable habit of denying us perfection. Suppose the manager"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2872","","This procedure of revising inferences about old information as new information arrives springs from a philosophical viewpoint that makes Bayes’s contribution strikingly modern: in a dynamic world, there is no single answer under conditions of uncertainty. The mathematician A.F.M. Smith has summed it up well: “Any approach to scientific inference which seeks to legitimise an answer in response to complex uncertainty is, for me, a totalitarian parody of a would-be rational learning process.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 6281","","Behavioral finance analyzes how investors struggle to find their way through the give and take between risk and return, one moment engaging in cool calculation and the next yielding to emotional impulses. The result of this mixture between the rational and not-so-rational is a capital market that itself fails to perform consistently in the way that the theoretical models predict that it will perform. Meir Statman, a professor"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 6392","","As an example of Prospect Theory, Thaler and DeBondt demonstrated that, when new information arrives, investors revise their beliefs, not according to the objective methods set forth by Bayes, but by overweighting the new information and underweighting prior and longer-term information."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 7184","","As we look ahead toward the new millennium, what are the prospects that we can finish that job, that we can hope to bring more risks under control and make progress at the same time? The answer must focus on Leibniz’s admonition of 1703, which is as pertinent today as it was when he sent it off to Jacob Bernoulli: “Nature has established patterns originating in the return of events, but only for the most part.” As I pointed out in the Introduction, that qualification is the key to the whole"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 7321","","Nothing is more soothing or more persuasive than the computer screen, with its imposing arrays of numbers, glowing colors, and elegantly structured graphs. As we stare at the passing show, we become so absorbed that we tend to forget that the computer only answers questions; it does not ask them. Whenever we ignore that truth, the computer supports us in our conceptual errors. Those who live only by the numbers may find that the computer has simply replaced the oracles to whom people resorted in ancient times for guidance in risk management and decision-making."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 7331","","The central theme of this whole story is that the quantitative achievements of the heroes we have met shaped the trajectory of progress over the past 450 years. In engineering, medicine, science, finance, business, and"
