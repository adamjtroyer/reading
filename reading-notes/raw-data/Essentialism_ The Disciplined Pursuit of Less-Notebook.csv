"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 3","","Instead of making just a millimeter of progress in a million directions he began to generate tremendous momentum towards accomplishing the things that were truly vital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 4","","In this example is the basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 4","","Now let me ask you this: Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin? Have you ever felt both overworked and underutilized? Have you ever found yourself majoring in minor activities? Do you ever feel busy but not productive? Like you’re always in motion, but never getting anywhere? If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the way of the Essentialist."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 6","","Less but better. A more fitting definition of Essentialism would be hard to come by."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 6","","Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 7","","The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 14","","As Peter Drucker said, “In a few hundred years, when the history of our time will be written from a long-term perspective, it is likely that the most important event historians will see is not technology, not the Internet, not e-commerce. It is an unprecedented change in the human condition. For the first time—literally—substantial and rapidly growing numbers of people have choices. For the first time, they will have to manage themselves. And society is totally unprepared for it.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 17","","In the same way that our closets get cluttered as clothes we never wear accumulate, so do our lives get cluttered as well-intended commitments and activities we’ve said yes to pile up. Most of these efforts didn’t come with an expiration date. Unless we have a system for purging them, once adopted, they live on in perpetuity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 19","","Essentialism is about creating a system for handling the closet of our lives. This is not a process you undertake once a year, once a month, or even once a week, like organizing your closet. It is a discipline you apply each and every time you are faced with a decision about whether to say yes or whether to politely decline. It’s a method for making the tough trade-off between lots of good things and a few really great things. It’s about learning how to do less but better so you can achieve the highest possible return on every precious moment of your life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 26","","What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 45","","The overwhelming reality is: we live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable. As John Maxwell has written, “You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 60","","Because Essentialists will commit and “go big” on only the vital few ideas or activities, they explore more options at first to ensure they pick the right one later."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 62","","If you believe being overly busy and overextended is evidence of productivity, then you probably believe that creating space to explore, think, and reflect should be kept to a minimum. Yet these very activities are the antidote to the nonessential busyness that infects so many of us. Rather than trivial diversions, they are critical to distinguishing what is actually a trivial diversion from what is truly essential."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 64","","One leader I worked with admitted to staying at a company five years too long. Why? Because he was so busy in the company he didn’t take time to decide whether he should be at the company. The demands of each day kept him from really stepping back to get perspective."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 76","","The best journalists, as Friedman shared later with me, listen for what others do not hear. At the lunch, he had been listening for what was being said only at the periphery. He was listening more for what was not being said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 86","","Play is fundamental to living the way of the Essentialist because it fuels exploration in at least three specific ways. First, play broadens the range of options available to us."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 87","","Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 87","","Third, as Edward M. Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in brain science, explains, play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 102","","Sleep will enhance your ability to explore, make connections, and do less but better throughout your waking hours."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 103","","The key is to put the decision to an extreme test: if we feel total and utter conviction to do something, then we say yes, Derek-style. Anything less gets a thumbs down. Or as a leader at Twitter once put it to me, “If the answer isn’t a definite yes then it should be a no.” It is a succinct summary of a core Essentialist principle, and one that is critical to the process of exploration."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 121","","When I ask people, “What do you really want out of your career over the next five years?” I am still taken aback by how few people can answer the question."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 121","","When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 126","","An essential intent, on the other hand, is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 127","","An essential intent doesn’t have to be elegantly crafted; it’s the substance, not the style that counts. Instead, ask the more essential question that will inform every future decision you will ever make: “If we could be truly excellent at only one thing, what would it be?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 148","","This is because of something called “the endowment effect,” our tendency to undervalue things that aren’t ours and to overvalue things because we already own them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 149","","Tom Stafford describes a simple antidote to the endowment effect.6 Instead of asking, “How much do I value this item?” we should ask, “If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 151","","The tendency to continue doing something simply because we have always done it is sometimes called the “status quo bias.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 160","","Many people have been credited with coming up with this apt sentiment: “I must apologize: if I had more time I would have written a shorter letter.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 181","","In filtering out 7 companies from 20,400, the authors found that the ones that executed most successfully did not have any better ability to predict the future than their less successful counterparts. Instead, they were the ones who acknowledged they could not predict the unexpected and therefore prepared better."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 182","","Of the variety of explanations for why we underestimate the amount of time something will take, I believe social pressure is the most interesting. One study found that if people estimated anonymously how long it would take to complete a task they were no longer guilty of the planning fallacy.9 This implies that often we actually know we can’t do things in a given time frame, but we don’t want to admit it to someone."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 183","","One way to protect against this is simply to add a 50 percent buffer to the amount of time we estimate it will take to complete a task or project (if 50 percent seems overly generous, consider how frequently things actually do take us 50 percent longer than expected)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 184","","Essentialists accept the reality that we can never fully anticipate or prepare for every scenario or eventuality; the future is simply too unpredictable. Instead, they build in buffers to reduce the friction caused by the unexpected."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 199","","A popular idea in Silicon Valley is “Done is better than perfect.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 236","","This story captures the two most personal learnings that have come to me on the long journey of writing this book. The first is the exquisitely important role of my family in my life. At the very, very end, everything else will fade into insignificance by comparison. The second is the pathetically tiny amount of time we have left of our lives."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 238","","If you take one thing away from this book, I hope you will remember this: whatever decision or challenge or crossroads you face in your life, simply ask yourself, “What is essential?” Eliminate everything else."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 239","","LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner sees “fewer things done better” as the most powerful mechanism for leadership."
