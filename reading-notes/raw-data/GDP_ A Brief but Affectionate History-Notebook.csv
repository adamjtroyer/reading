"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 107","","GDP is the way we measure and compare how well or badly countries are doing. But this is not a question of measuring a natural phenomenon like land mass or average temperature to varying degrees of accuracy. GDP is a made-up entity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 130","","In 2000, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis declared GDP to be “One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 133","","I also ask whether GDP alone is still a good enough measure of economic performance—and conclude not. It is a measure designed for the twentieth-century economy of physical mass production, not for the modern economy of rapid innovation and intangible, increasingly digital, services. How well the economy is doing is always going to be an important part of everyday politics, and we’re going to need a better measure of “the economy” than today’s GDP."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 175","","Only those involved in the making of physical commodities, agriculture and industry, would count toward national income. The provision of more services was a cost to the national economy,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 177","","Importantly, money spent on warfare or the interest on government debt was also being used unproductively. The nation’s wealth was its stock of physical assets less the national debt. National income was what derived from the national wealth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 186","","The idea of a distinction between productive and unproductive activity, adopted by Adam Smith, dominated economic debate and measurement until the late nineteenth century. Karl Marx echoed it, and it remained the basis for measuring the centrally planned economies until the collapse of communism after"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 251","","The discussions were highly technical but the underlying issue was profound: what was the meaning of economic growth and why were statisticians measuring it? Gilbert and his colleagues were clear that the aim was to have a measurement that was useful to the government in running its fiscal policy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 272","","For two centuries, “the economy” was the private sector. Government played a small role in economic life, and featured mainly because it looked to raise taxes to pay for wars."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 326","","GDP statistics and Keynesian macroeconomic policy were mutually reinforcing. The story of GDP since 1940 is also the story of macroeconomics. The availability of national accounts statistics made demand management"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 376","","There is no such entity as GDP out there in the real world waiting to be measured by economists. It is an abstract idea, and one that after a half century of international discussion and standard-setting has become extremely complicated. The manuals for statisticians run to hundreds of pages, and it takes a substantial investment of time and effort to understand the national accounts in any detail."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 425","","GDP counts all the economic output generated within the nation’s boundary. GNP counts all the economic output generated by national entities, some of it occurring overseas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 516","","The trouble with using old weights is that the structure of the economy changes quite dramatically over time. In many African, Asian, and Latin American economies, the GDP calculations take no account of phenomena such as globalization, or the mobile phone revolution in the developing world."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 533","","statistical changes).30 For this reason, the developed economies’ national accounts for the most part now use a “chain-weighted” price index in the calculation of real GDP, meaning that the weights used to combine the separate prices into one index change steadily year by year."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 548","","The seemingly technical issue of how best to calculate a price index has some profound implications, ones which economists routinely ignore. In short, the choice of techniques completely alters even the broad outlines of the big picture on economic growth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 553","","Sometimes an increase in the price of an item reflects an improvement in quality, and failing to take account of this would lead to an underestimate of real GDP."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 607","","Decisions like these concern what is known as the “production boundary”: what counts as economic output? Government expenditure and household services (such as cleaning and home-grown vegetables) are just two obvious fuzzy areas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 614","","There is an equally general consensus that household services should not be included—although including their value (as discussed in chapter 6) might add 50 percent or more to estimates of GDP, much more than the scale of the government contribution."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 630","","Finally, and above all, it is important to recognize that GDP is not a measure of welfare. It—notoriously—counts the services of lawyers and other “bads” as a positive. So too the rebuilding of bridges and homes after a storm like Katrina or Sandy, or floods. GDP measures output; it does not measure well-being. Much more on this, too, as this brief history unfolds."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 664","","GDP does not measure the nation’s assets or balance sheet, only its flow of income, expenditure, and production from year to year."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 772","","The use of PPP conversion rates, done unthinkingly by most economists, is controversial, however. Compared to converting every country’s GDP to one currency using the prevailing market exchange rate, the PPP conversion factors will raise the relative level of GDP of those low-income countries where nontraded goods and services are cheap. That was, after all, the point of devising the purchasing power parity concept. But many critics think the PPP conversion ends up overstating the income of poor countries. Recent research confirms suggestions that the PPP approach understates the differences in living standards among different countries."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 794","","The statistical controversy has immense practical consequence: purchasing power parities are widely used to measure and compare living standards and economic performance around the world. They are the basis of almost every economic study looking at how countries grow. They determine policy choices made by national governments and international agencies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 824","","The question the raw data should be used to answer is: “How much must the average expenditure in one country be increased to enable its typical inhabitant to have the same standard of living as a typical inhabitant of a richer country?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 826","","The economist Nicholas Oulton has used the same data as the World Bank in its International Comparison Program to calculate instead (using an econometric technique) what he describes as “true PPPs.” Using these shows that “the standard of living in the poorest countries is now only about half the level estimated using the World Bank’s PPPs.”11"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 842","","The comparisons do provide useful information. But the large margin of uncertainty around this information should never be forgotten."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 851","","Solow’s model of growth remained the basic workhorse theory until the 1980s. It said that the economy’s growth of its total output depended on the growth in the inputs needed—land or materials, labor and capital—and an unexplained remainder or residual labeled “technical progress.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 872","","The Marshall Aid–funded increase in investment succeeded brilliantly in achieving the Plan’s aims of turning previously hostile and dreadfully impoverished nations into peaceful, prosperous trading partners. The United States’ Marshall Plan remains one of the most visionary acts of statesmanship ever put into practice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1066","","The indicator he launched, the Human Development Index (HDI), built on the idea of measuring capabilities rather than income."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1087","","The gap between incomes per capita of the world’s poorest and richest countries has soared in the past half century. But in many other ways—the indicators included in the HDI—there is good news."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1116","","Even those that had been gathering some kind of national income statistics for a long period did not have data series that were consistent over time because the definitions had changed so much. Thirty years’ worth of annual data for sixty countries is not much when it comes to testing detailed causal explanations of growth, especially with one year’s figures similar to the previous year’s (because GDP and its components do not change much over time—the norm is a change of 1–3 percent a year)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1136","","It is not possible to explore these dynamics of innovation without having long runs of economic statistics."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1138","","This means that until just over ten years ago, economists trying to explain growth were really flying blind."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1169","","Studies of businesses investing in computer and communications equipment in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s indicate that without restructuring the business, productivity gains are small. But those that do restructure experience very large improvements in productivity.6"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1213","","As the word suggests, productivity is related to products. It measures number of units of output per unit of inputs. The main input in a service business is the time spent by the employees on their job. What is the output of a teacher, though? Number of children processed through the school?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1219","","These are, of course, unanswerable questions. The concept doesn’t really fit. Yet services account for more than two-thirds of GDP in the OECD economies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1231","","Over the decades and centuries, the price of a lumen or unit of light fell dramatically. At the same time, the quality of lighting increased profoundly.11 The raw statistics that go into the estimates of GDP—the number of candles bought or the number of light bulbs and lamps—never fully captured the scale of either the decline in price or the improvement in quality."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1254","","the Boskin Commission. As discussed earlier, its 1996 report concluded that by failing to take account of the quality changes in goods such as computers, cameras, and phones, the U.S. Consumer Price Index had been overstating the rate of inflation by 1.3 percentage points a year, and correspondingly understating real GDP growth by compensating for phantom price increases. What appeared to be rising prices (or less rapidly declining prices) in fact reflected massive improvements in quality and in the benefits consumers derived from these goods."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1258","","The other consequence of the commission’s report was that statistical agencies in the United States and elsewhere increasingly turned to the use of what is known as “hedonic” price indexes in calculating the general price index to turn dollar GDP figures into a real-terms measure."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1261","","The aim of a hedonic index is to take account of quality changes in order to figure out the true price of the underlying benefit to the user. To calculate the hedonic price of a computer is to seek the price of certain characteristics that are bundled up in a computer. The statisticians take the actual price paid for personal computers of all kinds, and also gather data on the different characteristics of the machines people are buying. What is their memory size? Screen size and resolution? Do they have built-in Wi-Fi? The actual price is then regressed on these various characteristics—that"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1271","","That was to switch to counting purchases of software by companies as a form of investment rather than a purchase of an intermediate good as it had been."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1300","","In a book published in 1996 I noted the phenomenon that growth in GDP for more than a decade had literally not weighed anything: all the incremental value-added growth was in intangibles of one kind or another.16 A measure of the national economy designed for tangible, physical products only is not really a good measure of an increasingly weightless economy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1303","","The lesson to draw from this discussion is that GDP is not, and was never intended to be, a measure of welfare. It measures production."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1394","","A reason to be suspicious can be found in the United Kingdom’s GDP statistics for the final quarter of 2008, the period during which Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the global money markets were on the verge of ceasing to function. In that quarter, the statistics showed the fastest growth in the United Kingdom’s financial sector on record. The figures suggested finance was making roughly the same contribution as manufacturing to the economy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1412","","Unable to imagine when this was written that banking could be subtracting value from the economy, statisticians sought to find a way of measuring these earnings from financial intermediation. So for many years the convention was to count financial services as the negative output of an imaginary segment of the economy. It is, to use a phrase from Alice in Wonderland, curiouser and curiouser. As the financial services industry grew throughout the 1980s, the approach changed again, and the 1993 update of the UN System of National Accounts introduced the concept of “financial intermediation services indirectly measured,” or FISIM. This current measure compares banks’ borrowing and lending rates on their loan and deposit portfolios to a risk-free “reference rate” such as the central bank’s policy rate, and multiplies the difference by the stock of outstanding balances in each case. The practical difficulties are enormous, especially when it comes to translating this into an inflation-adjusted or real-terms figure.10 But in principle it made sense as a way of measuring the service provided by banks in taking on risk."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1474","","The financial crisis has led many people to question the way only the monetary values that are measured by GDP seem to matter. The financial sector seems to symbolize the undue weight society gives to the growth of some activities rather than others. The crisis has given fresh impetus to the continuing debate about whether we should be measuring GDP and paid-for output, or instead looking for a measure of well-being or social welfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1488","","Richard Stone, one of the founding fathers of national accounts, was perfectly up-front about the arbitrariness of what was included and how: “This treatment, whereby commercial products are valued at market price, government services are valued at cost and unpaid household activities are simply ignored, is not a matter of principle but of practical convenience. It can be defended, therefore, only on practical grounds.”21 The imaginary"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1523","","In developing countries, the proportion of GDP accounted for by economic activity that stays outside the official net for taxes and scrutiny is high: the “informal” economy will be large in a poor country where many people work as self-employed entrepreneurs, farmers, or day laborers. In developed countries, the proportion is variable, ranging from around 7 percent of GDP in the United States and 8 percent of GDP in Switzerland to 20 percent in Italy and 25 percent in Greece (all 2012 estimates). The average is about 15 percent of GDP. In the formerly communist “transition” economies, the typical share of the shadow economy is 21–30 percent, and in poorer developing economies 35–44 percent of GDP. The informal economy has been growing in size around the"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1561","","Even in good times, however, the scale of this informal, unpaid work is significant: it accounts for more than half of all the time people spend working. If this is valued at money wages paid for similar work, it is equivalent to 1.85 times the size of the conventional national product figure for the United Kingdom in 2001.27 Although the figure will vary among countries, the importance of this activity, conventionally but arbitrarily excluded from official GDP statistics, is universal. It would be paradoxical if most statistical agencies continue not to produce estimates of household production, if they are now going to follow the official methodology and try to measure illegal marketed activities."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1624","","the empirical evidence for the happiness bandwagon is weak. The idea that once countries had grown comfortably rich, it is folly to pursue further economic growth, has struck a chord. It is important, though, to be clear that GDP is not and was not intended to be a measure of national welfare. Economists have repeatedly cautioned themselves and others not to get the two mixed up."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1773","","GDP underrecords growth by failing to capture fully the increase in the range of products in the economy. It is a poor way to measure innovation and customization, and the extent to which it undermeasures them is extremely large."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1774","","also fails to record at all another increasingly important category, namely, preventive goods or services."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1812","","Just as “output” is a concept best suited to an economy made up of products rather than services, and similar, mass-produced products at that, so is “productivity.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1869","","The gap between what a consumer pays and the value he or she receives from the purchase is called “consumer surplus,” and the growing prevalence of zero-priced goods and services online seems to be increasing consumer surplus.14"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1882","","Official statisticians need to start thinking about how to measure better the production and consumption of “information” or digital products that clearly deliver value to consumers. Because GDP measures only monetary transactions, the new “free” business models are not being well measured, and neither are the new types of activity with zero market price but of great value to consumers."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1963","","Despite such caveats, GDP does a good job of measuring how fast (or not) the output of “the economy” is growing, and GDP growth is closely linked to social welfare. GDP struggles with measuring innovation, quality, and intangibles, but it does a better job than any currently available alternative."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1971","","National statistical offices should either do regular time-use surveys so they can monitor the informal economy, or develop other measures of household production. There is no good rationale for ignoring it, and it is no harder to measure than illegal drugs or prostitution."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1997","","National statisticians in the developed economies have perhaps not been best placed to experiment with online or mobile collection of raw data."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2026","","Meanwhile, it is above all important not to confuse GDP with social welfare. The way the economy has changed has made the gap between GDP and welfare bigger than it used to be."
