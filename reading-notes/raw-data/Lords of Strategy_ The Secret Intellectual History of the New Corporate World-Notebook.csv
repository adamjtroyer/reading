"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 100","","the three Cs central to any good strategy: the company’s costs, especially costs relative to other companies; the definition of the markets the company served—its customers, in other words—and its position vis à vis competitors."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 131","","This book will argue their case, warts, major moral disfigurements, and all. As far as I know, the volume in your hands represents the first book-length treatment of the strategy revolution. Know what it aims to be and what not. It’s an exercise in journalism more than scholarship, albeit what I think of as the journalism of ideas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 183","","Henderson was also a pioneer in that he looked at the challenges facing his clients as mysteries to be solved, usually through massive and creative data gathering, then fitting the data to a framework, or supplying such a framework, to explain it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 605","","The experience curve was, simply, the single most important concept in launching the strategy revolution."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 695","","Up until the 1980s at least, most of the clients of BCG and the other strategy consulting firms were industrial companies. The story of the strategy revolution is thus, in some considerable measure, about how these enterprises sought ideas from the consultants and others to help them stem what turned out to be an inexorable decline."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 829","","Note, though, that none of these criticisms dispute the curve’s existence or call into question its power to discipline a company’s thinking around the imperative to cut costs incessantly. Its forcefulness and menace endure into the twenty-first century, as a senior partner of a strategy firm observes: “The experience curve is like what Newton discovered with the law of gravity. It’s a fundamental law of nature. People disobey it at their peril.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1418","","The product of Bain’s efforts was to be not a report or a study—the firm’s consultants still drip with disdain at the mention of such things—but rather a strategy and, even more important, results—results that you could see first on the bottom line, then in the stock price. Fairly quickly, this value proposition was boiled down to a snappy formulation: “We don’t sell advice by the hour; we sell profits at a discount.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1626","","McKinsey espouses and, at its best, puts into practice a principle it calls the democracy of ideas. The notion, to be commended to any company dependent on the bright minds of its people—which by the middle of the twenty-first century, will be every company—is that an idea or insight should be judged on its content, not on the seniority of its source, or lack thereof. Sounds like motherhood and apple pie, but fiendishly difficult to make work, in part because mother and father seem to hard-wire a degree of hierarchicalism into our human natures. Fred"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2064","","That led to the generic strategies,” the subject of his chapter 2 and the other big idea that the book became famous for. There were essentially three strategies a company could choose, he posited: low-cost leadership (beloved of fans of the experience curve), product differentiation (making your offering so distinctive that you could charge more for it), or market specialization (pick a niche and dominate it)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2077","","For all the niggles one may have with it, Competitive Strategy did more than any other book to consolidate the advances of the strategy revolution, bring scholarly respectability to its subject matter, and brand the paradigm as one that needed to be at the center of both corporate deliberation and business school education."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2301","","Peters and Waterman would each return again and again to the centrality of people to a company’s success—employees as the source of innovation, well-executed service, and continued corporate learning, customers as people whose wishes must be understood, honored, and if possible exceeded."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2454","","What we would be looking for in an alternative to the strategy model—a unified theory of management, if you will—would be a construct addressing each of the issues a company faces in dealing with people: how they were to be selected, trained, disciplined, compensated, motivated, managed, and led (if you admit a distinction between the last two). The unified theory would demonstrate how each of these elements related to one another, in ways that could be both predicted and controlled, how they could be measured, and how their combined effect determined the fate of the organization, preferably in dollar-and-cents terms that would satisfy the most exacting chief financial officer. In the world of this paradigm’s triumph, no CEO would dream of standing before an audience without a detailed explanation of how his or her company was exploiting the principles of the unified theory to achieve competitive success."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2528","","This takes us to perhaps the most common, thoroughly understandable mistake made by readers of management literature: they fall for what I call the myth of corporate persistence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2560","","As Foster notes, of the five hundred companies on the original S&P 500 in 1957, only seventy-four survived on the list until 1998—most who disappeared were merged out of existence, not victims of bankruptcy—and the stocks of only twelve outperformed the S&P index itself over that period. Foster in particular bangs away at the point: “McKinsey’s long-term studies of corporate birth, survival, and death in America clearly show that the corporate equivalent of El Dorado, the golden company that continually performs better than the markets, has never existed. It is a myth. Managing for survival, even among the best and most revered corporations, does not guarantee strong long-term performance for shareholders. In fact, just the opposite is true. In the long run, markets always win.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2574","","In 2005, in their best-seller Blue Ocean Strategy, INSEAD professors W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne argued that companies were better served trying to invent new markets (“the blue ocean”) rather than fighting it out on seas already beset and bleeding with established competitors (“the red ocean”). Their research on successful blue-ocean moves took them through the work of Foster and others and led them to conclude, with wonderful audacity, that if “there is no perpetually high-performing company and if the same company can be brilliant one moment and wrongheaded at another, it appears that the company is not the appropriate unit of analysis in exploring the roots of high performance and blue oceans.” The unit of analysis that they recommended"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2592","","“I desperately believe that virtually all the behavior of an enterprise is a pretty much direct inheritance of its gene pool. Whatever it was, it will stay. Microsoft is a centralized, personality-driven company, and that’s what it will always be. Many of the companies we looked at—Hewlett-Packard, 3M—were decentralized from the start”—all the better for “loose-tight properties” and “autonomy and entrepreneurship.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2599","","Foster’s first book, in 1986, was Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage. By the time he coauthored Creative Destruction, he was even clearer on the chief impediment to innovation or adaptation: what he called “cultural lock-in.” Such lock-in, embodied in a company’s “rules of thumb for decision making, its control processes, and the information it used for decision making,” kept it from recognizing changes in its environment, left it unable to “shed operations with a less-exciting future,” and ultimately signaled “the corporation’s inexorable decline into inferior performance.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2637","","After a little more back-and-forth, the final estimate would emerge: fewer than 10 percent of their clients, in the consultants’ judgment, were fully successful at putting their corporate strategies to work. But that wasn’t the element of the"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2724","","What I took from that conversation was that what a counselor actually did was help the client understand their own issues and work out their own solutions. The counselor was a facilitator, a structurer of the problem, a prober of questions, but never provided the answer. That was up to the client.” Aha, thought Hall."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2785","","In its ideal form, Hall’s new model of consulting would take an iterative, semi-Socratic dynamic all the way through the project to what might seem its conclusion. There, he put in place another radical innovation, one totally consistent with his philosophy: when the results of the study jointly performed by BCG and the client team were finally presented to senior management or the board, Hall insisted that the presentation be conducted entirely by the client’s people (even if the consultants might have written much of it)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2813","","The experience curve in particular needed reexamination. To their surprise, consultants were also discovering that there appeared to be industries for which low cost was no guarantee of competitive advantage. Enter the possibilities for differentiation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2848","","The explanation turned out to be another variation on scale economies, namely, that in certain industries, no economies were to be gained beyond a certain minimum efficient scale, which could be embodied in, say, a single machine."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2864","","The original, unitary paradigm of strategy, built on the nexus of costs as determined by experience and market share, turned out to obtain in some industries, but not in all. In those where it didn’t, participants would have to seek new sources of competitive advantage."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2887","","The growth-share matrix, which Lochridge had helped perfect, had made a “major contribution to strategic thought,” but had become “misused and overexposed”—read “commoditized”—sometimes still useful but also"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2909","","“McKinsey was always interested in helping our clients figure out ways they could raise prices. I’m not sure that BCG, with its focus on costs, had the same emphasis.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2911","","Cavanagh’s observation raises a distinction, or more precisely a pull between two directions, that we’ll see in the evolution of strategy from the 1980s on. On the one hand was the imperative to cut costs now and forever—an imperative born of the experience curve. On the other was the tantalizing prospect of somehow “creating value” for the customer, developing an offering that because of its novelty, special features, or appeal, can command a higher price than the commodity version. Some aspect of creating value lies at the heart of any strategy based on differentiation or specialization. But can’t a company"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2989","","Competitive Advantage, far more than Porter’s earlier book, Competitive Strategy, represents a compendium almost breathtaking in its reach of the best thinking on strategy up until then, as well as a brilliant anticipation of many of the issues that would engage and challenge practitioners in the decades that followed. It provides the intellectual template for the age of breaking the world into pieces. Just by putting the notion"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3056","","This school of thought sees shareholder capitalism as short-sighted, smacking of greed, and in the end unrealistic in that it fails to take into account other constituencies or—the preferred term—stakeholders that a corporation’s actions necessarily touch, namely, the company’s employees, customers, suppliers, and home communities."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3198","","The goal for corporate managers had become clear—to increase the value of the company, as reflected in its stock price—and fast."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3212","","Their third, and perhaps most eye-catching point was their explication of the idea that while some of a company’s businesses served to increase its stock price, others might actually be dragging the price down, or, in the ominous phrase the consultants used, “destroying value.” This alarming possibility derived from finance theory, specifically from the concepts of economic profits or residual income. Boiled down, the assertion was that to arrive at a true estimate of a business’s profitability, you had to deduct from its revenues not just the usual costs, but also a charge for the capital tied up in the business."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3225","","No, the consultants counseled, sell off the turkeys and you may see something of a miracle: even as your company grows smaller, as measured by its revenues, your stock price will increase. In the businesses you retain, to further boost your stock price—and the fourth of the value consultants’ innovative emphases—tie managers’ compensation explicitly to how much economic profit their operations generate and to increases in that profit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3255","","There is a theory—Canadian scholar Danny Miller lays it out nicely in a 1991 book, The Icarus Paradox—that when companies truly get into the deepest trouble, it’s usually not because of their weaknesses but rather because of their strengths. Or more specifically, it’s because they tend to overdo the very energies, inclinations, and expertise that brought them success. Think of Enron and its manic quest to introduce markets, deal making, and new financial instruments to one sector of the energy business after another."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3373","","Probably the most memorable lines from the article came in a quote from the head of another consulting firm: “Their product is brilliant. It’s the package that has been a problem. Five million Bainies saying, ‘Stand aside, asshole. Here we come.’” And if the"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3427","","strategy that was holistic—from conception through implementation—aggressive, elitist, slightly paranoid, and, to use its own favorite descriptor, ravenously results-oriented. The firm was without equal in teaching its clients the principles of Greater Taylorism and its uses. With Bain’s help, many of those clients achieved spectacular results, often reflected in the wealth they created for shareholders. And yet, the client relationship frequently didn’t endure—Bain has some clients of many years standing, but not as many as does McKinsey or BCG—and in their wake, Bain consultants often left behind festering resentments, a sense that the company had been taken over by an alien force (which strategy can be). By many measures,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3454","","In a speech from late in the 1990s, George Stalk Jr., arguably BCG’s leading thinker on strategy over the prior fifteen years—and certainly the firm’s most prolific—neatly summed up the main themes of the era, in the process making clear how far his firm had traveled from original Hendersonianism: “In this new environment, the essence of strategy is not the structure of a company’s position in products and markets, but the dynamics of its behaviors. The goal is to identify and develop the hard-to-imitate organizational capabilities that distinguish a company from its competitors. A capability is a set of business processes, strategically understood.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3639","","The aim of strategy should be to “create tomorrow’s competitive advantages faster than competitors mimic the ones you possess today.” The secret to doing this lies in the corporation’s skills and its ability to acquire new ones—“learning,” in other words—which the authors describe as “the most defensible competitive advantage of all.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3651","","A core competence is “communication, involvement, and a deep commitment to working across organizational boundaries.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3820","","Operational effectiveness thus boiled down, for Porter, to pretty much performing the same activities as your competitors, but more efficiently than they do. In contrast—drumroll here—“Strategic positioning means performing different activities from rivals’ or performing similar activities in different ways.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3841","","Porter’s lead example of fit done right—indeed, in this era, seemingly everyone’s favorite example of fit or what others called focus—was Southwest Airlines. In pursuit of its fly-cheap strategy, it had confronted the trade-offs, made the choices, and achieved the fit: only short flights, no meal service or link-ups with other airlines, only one type of aircraft for shorter turnarounds and more time in the"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3985","","McKinsey, if asked how much of its business comes under that heading, will usually shrug gracefully and say “Perhaps thirty percent.” Slightly keener-eyed estimates from insiders put the figure for each of three firms at between fifteen and twenty percent. None of the three resemble what a security analyst might call a pure-play strategy consultant. That beast no longer exists, or if it does, it is the size of an insect and can escape our notice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4340","","Fastening on people as the critical resource for innovation and growth is the first of three ways of conceiving of strategy as centered on people we’ll look at in this chapter."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4342","","The second version of strategy as people consists of attempts to use the concept of the network to analyze ways in which individuals relate to one another, this as a stepping-stone to competitive advantage. The third version may seem the most surprising: private equity, and what private equity firms do with the businesses they acquire, as a kind of apotheosis of strategy. The"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4429","","Hamel offered nine “routes to industry revolution,” gambits such as “radically improving the value equation,” “compressing the supply chain,” and “driving convergence.” But the main thrust of the article and the ensuing book was that strategy-making must be made democratic. Companies should seek out revolutionaries from among their twenty-five-year olds, from people serving on the corporate periphery far from headquarters, and from newcomers “who have not yet been co-opted by an industry’s dogmas … What senior executives must not do is ask a small, elite group or the ‘substitute brains’ of a traditional strategy-consulting firm to go away and plot the company’s future.” Indeed, in the heaven he painted, every company would constitute a democracy of ideas (as McKinsey in its best moments aspired to be)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4456","","Evans is the only thinker I’ve encountered who talks about the ontology of strategy (the philosophy of being it’s premised on) and its epistemology (its theory of the nature of knowledge, in this instance, the knowledge of how to achieve competitive advantage). “Porter took a lens from structuralist economics, but he applied it to, quote unquote, an industry,” Evans argues. “What’s an industry? A small number of largely similar organizations, internally collaborative, externally competitive, that connect to each other through the mechanism of a competitive market, and connect upstream to suppliers, downstream to customers."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4462","","But strategy evolved. “When capabilities came along,” Evans argues, “that changed the epistemology—it said, ‘No, competitive advantage is not identification of structural differences; it’s the identification of capabilities.’ But the ontology stayed exactly the same—companies competing with one another in an industry.” Perhaps not forever, though. “The deconstruction logic challenges the ontology,” argues Evans. “It says, ‘Wait a second. Who says there’s this thing called “the business,” or “the company,” or “the industry”?’” He then cites a soon-to-be former industry in which he did a lot of consulting: “What’s the media industry, anymore? Blogs? Who are the customers, who are the suppliers? If customers start talking to one another, who’s supplying whom?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4469","","The generation of strategic thinking we’re now entering challenges the earlier ontological assumptions. It says that the only irreducible unit in this picture is the person—the customer, worker, or executive. It says that people engage in transactions, broadly defined, that may be competitive, or may be cooperative, but what emerges is a network. As technology drives down the costs of transactions, breaking the constraints of distance or of institutions, those networks become more fluid.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4794","","Strategists had been incorporating risk into their calculations as far back as Alan Zakon’s work for Weyerhaeuser, when he showed that because the timber company had relatively low operating risk, it could take on more of the financial variety—that is, borrow more. But with the passage of time, the advisers’ concern with risk had been subordinated to other themes or consigned to particular projects, say, the decision about whether a mining or oil company should make a colossal investment to try to discover new reserves. Here there were relatively clear decision trees that could be followed down to weigh choices, and the possibility of applying options theory. But elsewhere, even as Y2K fears and then the September 11 attacks piqued corporate interest in risk management, the consultants had mostly left the subject to others, often to the client’s “chief risk officer,” himself or herself usually a subordinate of the CFO and not typically a member of the client’s inner councils on strategy. Asked to name sins of omission or commission they may have committed in connection with the global financial crisis, most consultants will allow that in their advice they failed to make sufficient provision for risk, particularly systemic risk. Their analytics, like those of the quants, had done such a wonderful job of chopping the world into small, measurable pieces that they could not foresee how the bits, with the risk inherent in each supposedly mitigated by distribution across a wide population of owners and operators, could suddenly seize up together into a nonworking, credit-frozen-up, risk-all-concentrated-in-the-same-damn-spots whole. “We didn’t see the danger of systemic risk,” admits one senior consultant, “but then, nobody did”—only a slight exaggeration. Part of the reason"

What good are a bunch of plans that just end up in binders sitting on the shelf? Isn’t execution, after all, what really gives you a competitive edge? Of more interest were"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4877","","strategy will necessarily become more adaptive. But then, as we have witnessed, hasn’t strategy always been adaptive, a set of conceptual responses to the most vexing problems companies were facing at the time? What’s new here?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4898","","history suggests four issues in particular that will press on the strategic consciousness of companies, whether that consciousness is centralized or more widely distributed: risk, boundaries, corporate purpose, and, as the apostles of the new adaptiveness suggest, figuring out for the twenty-first century how to power a company’s strategy with the maximum energy and imagination available from its people."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4902","","Frequently, this has translated into prescriptions for the use of debt, usually more debt. As the recent turmoil in the world’s financial markets brings home, calculations of risk need to be constantly reexamined as the global economy evolves, and disturbing new possibilities somehow taken into account. And not just financial risk. Economic collapse in countries far away, Internet bubbles that pop, terrorist threats to ever-tighter, leaned-down supply chains—how can the people in charge make provision for these in the corporate strategies they devise? At the heart"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4923","","The twenty-first-century version of the discipline will have to offer more help if, or when, the dominant verb for corporate behavior becomes not compete, but something like co-create."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4930","","The global financial crisis only added to the ranks of those questioning the maximization of shareholder wealth as the be-all and end-all of corporate activity. In March 2009, Jack Welch—of all people—told the Financial Times that “on the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world.” The man once viewed as the poster CEO for value creation went on to explain: “Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy,” and, more surprisingly, “Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers, and your products.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4939","","So, if the yardstick of shareholder value is to be abandoned as the principal measure of strategic success, what should a company be managed for? “Stability and growth,” Foster says,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4961","","Are we now, as a society—or a number of societies all inhabiting a capitalist world—ready to rethink our reliance on market mechanisms to produce the larger good? Are we prepared to sacrifice a degree of corporate profitability if that were to bring with it lessened extremes of wealth and poverty? What would be the right way to think about the goals of a corporation if the superordinate goal were not to maximize the wealth of its owners, the shareholders? And would an accounting that somehow, finally, accurately reflected all the ways employees contribute to corporate success make for organizations less inclined to chew up people? These are questions with enormous implications for strategy, but not ones that strategists have shown much willingness to engage. They have"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 4993","","The result is to create many of the features that one would hope for in a twenty-first-century enterprise: organizational due process that leaves most people feeling that they have been treated fairly. Democratic meritocracy open to talent from around the world. (Who among business outfits does globalization better?) A system of self-management that works even for people who adamantly don’t want to be managed, never wanted a boss."
