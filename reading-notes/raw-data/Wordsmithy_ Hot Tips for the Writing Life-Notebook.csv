"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 21","","Your native voice in writing is probably closer to the way you most naturally choose to speak than anything else. So you want to use this opportunity to import reality into your writing, instead of importing your writing into your reality."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 25","","Mark Twain once defined a classic as a book that everyone wanted to have read, but which no one wanted to read. In a similar spirit, lots of folks want to be “a writer” because they have had a few great ideas for a television script. They want to be a writer but are not all that thrilled about actually writing. They don’t want to write, they want to have written. So if you haven’t done anything yet, don’t talk as though you have."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 26","","There are some writers that I want to read no matter what they are talking about—because they are the kind of writers who write about things they love. And if, for their next book, they decided to love something really odd, that’s fine by me. They love it, and by the time I am done with their book, so shall"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 29","","We live in a narcissistic age, which means that many want to have the praise that comes from having read, without the antecedent labor of actually reading."

So here is the most basic rule. Be yourself. Don’t be boring. And if you are boring, try to deal with that first."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 34","","Go for total tonnage, and read like someone who will forget most of it. You have my permission to forget most of it, which may or may not be reassuring, but you will forget most of it in either case."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 42","","Set a lifetime pattern of reading books. Set a course of reading, and adopt general criteria which will guide your reading. I would recommend one to two books a week."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 43","","Read attentively and with your eyes open, but not as though you are cramming for a test. The reason you should not read as though studying for a test is that, as we have already noted, the vast majority of what you learn (with great profit) you will not be able to recall. Read with a pen, pencil, or highlighter so that you can mark things of interest in a way that will help you find them again, and keep your reading intelligent and interactive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 120","","The brain is more like a muscle that expands its capacity with increased use, and not very much like an attic crowded with boxes. The more you know, the more you can know. Take every advantage of every opportunity to learn your native language better, as well as any opportunities to learn other languages that will contribute to your writing."
