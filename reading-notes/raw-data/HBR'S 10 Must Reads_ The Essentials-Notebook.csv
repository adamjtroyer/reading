"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 54","","To succeed consistently, good managers need to be skilled not just in assessing people but also in assessing the abilities and disabilities of their organization as a whole."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 55","","This article offers managers a framework to help them understand what their organizations are capable of accomplishing. It will show them how their company’s disabilities become more sharply defined even as its core capabilities grow. It will"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 58","","And it will offer some bottom-line advice that runs counter to much that’s assumed in our can-do business culture: if an organization faces major change—a disruptive innovation, perhaps—the worst possible approach may be to make drastic adjustments to the existing organization. In trying to transform an enterprise, managers can destroy the very capabilities that sustain it. Before rushing"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 65","","Our research suggests that three factors affect what an organization can and cannot do: its resources, its processes, and its values."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 95","","processes, we mean the patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision making employees use to transform resources into products and services of greater worth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 113","","We define an organization’s values as the standards by which employees set priorities that enable them to judge whether an order is attractive or unattractive, whether a customer is more important or less important, whether an idea for a new product is attractive or marginal, and so"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 119","","A key metric of good management, in fact, is whether such clear, consistent values have permeated the organization."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 224","","Sustaining innovations are nearly always developed and introduced by established industry leaders. But those same companies never introduce—or cope well with—disruptive innovations. Why? Our resources-processes-values framework holds the answer. Industry leaders are organized to develop and introduce sustaining technologies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 242","","So whether addressing sustaining or disruptive innovations, when an organization needs new processes and values—because it needs new capabilities—managers must create a new organizational space where those capabilities can be developed. There are three possible ways to do that. Managers can • create new organizational structures within corporate boundaries in which new processes can be developed, • spin out an independent organization from the existing organization and develop within it the new processes and values required to solve the new problem, • acquire a different organization whose processes and values closely match the requirements of the new task. Creating new"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 357","","Managers whose organizations are confronting change must first determine whether they have the resources required to succeed. They then need to ask a separate question: Does the organization have the processes and values it needs to succeed in this new situation? Asking this second question is not as instinctive for most managers because the processes by which work is done and the values by which employees make their decisions have served them well in the past."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 366","","The reason that innovation often seems to be so difficult for established companies is that they employ highly capable people and then set them to work within organizational structures whose processes and values weren’t designed for the task at hand. Ensuring that capable people are ensconced in capable organizations is a major responsibility of management in a transformational age such as ours."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 422","","This article lays out the characteristics and practices of these statistical masters and describes some of the very substantial changes other companies must undergo in order to compete on quantitative turf."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 718","","The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 730","","Several implications for action follow from feedback analysis. First and foremost, concentrate on your strengths. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second, work on improving your strengths."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 733","","Third, discover where your intellectual arrogance is causing disabling ignorance and overcome"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 758","","To accurately identify your strengths, use feedback analysis. Every time you make a key decision, write down the outcome you expect. Several months later, compare the actual results with your expected results. Look for patterns in what you’re seeing:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 780","","Manners—simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” and knowing a person’s name or asking after her family—enable two people to work together whether they like each other or"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 785","","One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence. And yet most people—especially most teachers and most"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 852","","The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you cannot perform or will only perform poorly."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 922","","Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it, they must address three distinct elements: What does the situation require? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally, What results have to be achieved to make a difference? Consider the"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 930","","it is rarely possible—or even particularly fruitful—to look too far ahead. A plan can usually cover no more than 18 months and still be reasonably clear and specific. So the question in most cases should be, Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half? The answer must balance several"

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1044","","have found, however, that the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: They all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. It’s not that IQ and technical skills are irrelevant."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1081","","When I analyzed all this data, I found dramatic results. To be sure, intellect was a driver of outstanding performance. Cognitive skills such as big-picture thinking and long-term vision were particularly important. But when I calculated the ratio of technical skills, IQ, and emotional intelligence as ingredients of excellent performance, emotional intelligence proved to be twice as important as the others for jobs at all levels. Moreover, my analysis showed that"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1310","","a component of emotional intelligence, social skill is not as simple as it sounds. It’s not just a matter of friendliness, although people with high levels of social skill are rarely mean-spirited. Social skill, rather, is friendliness with a purpose: moving people in the direction you desire, whether that’s agreement on a new marketing strategy or enthusiasm about a new product."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2461","","How to ensure continued growth for your company? Concentrate on meeting customers’ needs rather than selling products. Chemical powerhouse DuPont kept a"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2540","","The history of every dead and dying “growth” industry shows a self-deceiving cycle of bountiful expansion and undetected decay. There are four conditions that usually guarantee this cycle: 1. The belief that growth is assured by an expanding and more affluent population; 2. The belief that there is no competitive substitute for the industry’s major product; 3. Too much faith in mass production and in the advantages of rapidly declining unit costs as output rises; 4. Preoccupation with a product that lends itself to carefully controlled scientific experimentation, improvement, and manufacturing cost reduction. I should"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2687","","Henry Ford. In a sense, Ford was both the most brilliant and the most senseless marketer in American history. He was senseless because he refused to give the customer anything but a black car. He was brilliant because he fashioned a production system designed to fit market needs. We habitually celebrate him for the wrong reason: for his production genius. His real genius was marketing. We think he was able to cut his selling price and therefore sell millions of $500 cars because his invention of the assembly line had reduced the costs. Actually, he invented the assembly line because he had concluded that at $500 he could sell millions of cars. Mass production was the result, not the cause, of his low prices."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2694","","Our policy is to reduce the price, extend the operations, and improve the article. You will notice that the reduction of price comes first. We have never considered any costs as fixed. Therefore we first reduce the price to the point where we believe more sales will result. Then we go ahead and try to make the prices. We do not bother about the costs. The new price forces the costs down. The"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2830","","The view that an industry is a customer-satisfying process, not a goods-producing process, is vital for all businesspeople to understand."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2831","","An industry begins with the customer and his or her needs, not with a patent, a raw material, or a selling skill."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2832","","Given the customer’s needs, the industry develops backwards, first concerning itself with the physical delivery of customer satisfactions. Then it moves back further to creating the things by which these satisfactions are in part achieved."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2910","","Operational effectiveness and strategy are both essential to superior performance, which, after all, is the primary goal of any enterprise. But they work in very different ways."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2938","","Strategic positioning attempts to achieve sustainable competitive advantage by preserving what is distinctive about a company. It means performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3000","","As rivals imitate one another’s improvements in quality, cycle times, or supplier partnerships, strategies converge and competition becomes a series of races down identical paths that no one can win. Competition based on operational effectiveness alone is mutually destructive, leading to wars of attrition that can be arrested only by limiting competition."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3160","","Having defined positioning, we can now begin to answer the question, “What is strategy?” Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities. If there were only one ideal position, there would be no need for strategy. Companies would face a simple imperative—win"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3231","","As we return to the question, What is strategy? we see that trade-offs add a new dimension to the answer. Strategy is making trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. Without trade-offs, there would be no need for choice and thus no need for strategy. Any good idea could and would be quickly imitated. Again, performance would once again depend wholly on operational effectiveness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3334","","One implication is that strategic positions should have a horizon of a decade or more, not of a single planning cycle. Continuity fosters improvements in individual activities and the fit across activities, allowing an organization to build unique capabilities and skills tailored to its strategy. Continuity also reinforces a company’s identity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3340","","What is strategy? We can now complete the answer to this question. Strategy is creating fit among a company’s activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well—not just a few—and integrating among them. If there is no fit among activities, there is no distinctive strategy and little sustainability."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3372","","The pursuit of operational effectiveness is seductive because it is concrete and actionable. Over the past decade, managers have been under increasing pressure to deliver tangible, measurable performance improvements. Programs in operational effectiveness produce reassuring progress, although superior profitability may remain elusive. Business publications and consultants flood the market with information about what other companies are doing, reinforcing the best-practice mentality. Caught up in the race for operational effectiveness, many managers simply do not understand the need to have a strategy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3411","","Among all other influences, the desire to grow has perhaps the most perverse effect on strategy. Trade-offs and limits appear to constrain growth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3639","","Core competencies are the collective learning in the organization, especially how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple streams of technologies."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3649","","Core competence is communication, involvement, and a deep commitment to working across organizational boundaries."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3700","","First, a core competence provides potential access to a wide variety of markets. Competence in display systems, for example,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3703","","Second, a core competence should make a significant contribution to the perceived customer benefits of the end product."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3704","","Finally, a core competence should be difficult for competitors to imitate. And it will be difficult if it is a complex harmonization"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3709","","Few companies are likely to build world leadership in more than five or six fundamental competencies. A company that compiles a list of 20 to 30 capabilities has probably not produced a list of core competencies."
