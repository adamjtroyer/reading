"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 26","","an incumbent in a market dominated by a few, with total information asymmetry, and the ability to make prices on the market rather than just take them, has little incentive to increase transparency."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 51","","The classic sign of a shitty startup idea is that it requires at least two (or more!) miracles to succeed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 81","","Around 2011 or so, and probably still to this day, the priciest word in the global auction on words was “mesothelioma.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 82","","What are the costliest Google keywords among relatively high-volume keywords? The ranking changes, but the top ten is always composed of some combination of “insurance,” “loans,” “mortgage,” “classes,” “credit,” “lawyer,” and so"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 93","","People go into startups thinking that the technical problems are the challenges. In practice, the technical stuff is easy, unless you’re incompetent or really at the hairy edge of human knowledge—for example, putting a man on Mars. No, every real problem in startups is a people problem, and as such they’re the hardest to solve, as they often don’t have a real solution, much less a ready software fix. Startups are experiments in group psychology. As CEO, you’re both the therapist leader, and the patient most in need of therapy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 103","","Silicon Valley is the zoo where the chaos monkeys are kept, and their numbers only grow in time. With the explosion of venture capital, there is no shortage of bananas to feed them. The question for society is whether it can survive these entrepreneurial chaos monkeys intact, and at what human cost."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 164","","First, the ability to monomaniacally and obsessively focus on one thing and one thing only, at the expense of everything else in life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 384","","submit that the role of modern-day Big Brother is actually played by companies you’ve likely never heard about. Companies with names like Axciom, Experian, Epsilon, Merkle, and Neustar (among others). These are the companies that since the dawn of the direct-marketing age in the sixties and seventies have been tracking all of consumer America. They know your name, address, phone number, email address, education level, rough income, who else is in your household and their ages and spending patterns, and which consumer segment you fit into—and they’ve been accumulating this information since before the Internet even existed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 385","","By the Post Office’s own figures, direct-mail advertising resulted in over $17 billion in revenue to the Post Office in postage alone, propping up what would otherwise be a bankrupt organization. The entire direct-mail industry, that crap in the mail you throw away, is surely north of a $50 billion a year industry if you consider design, printing, targeting data, and postage. To put that in perspective, all of Google makes just over that much in a year. In 2014, online marketers spent about $19 billion on display (basically, the Internet other than Google and Facebook). So we’ve got almost another Google, three Internets, or three Facebooks of money waiting in the offline sidelines."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 387","","Think about it: Media publishers like Facebook and Google are just more efficient versions of the post office. They deliver a message for money. They’ll even give you a return receipt if you ask for it. What’s different is the address they use to send it. In our mediated age, we’ve gotten to the point that a Facebook or Google user ID is a better way of reaching you than a name or physical address. I can scar your retinas for almost nothing (relatively) if I know your Facebook user ID; your name and address would do nothing for me—unless, of course, they provided the primary key to a database of buying behavior spanning decades. Which they do, and that’s the only reason, along with the legacy inertia of big-company business relationships, that Acxiom, Epsilon, et al. are even still in business."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 423","","So what happens to those globe-spanning bid requests, assuming they don’t drown in their trans-Atlantic undersea cable? The people listening for your presence in billions of such requests per day are known as “demand-side platforms” (DSPs), and they’re the stockbrokers of this real-time media world, working in the employ of the advertiser or agency who wants to sell you something.* The DSP quickly unpacks the bid request, and queries its data for anything it knows about you: sites you’ve browsed, shopping carts you’ve abandoned, that airfare quote you got and never acted upon. They’re all there and returned within milliseconds via state-of-the-art databases hyperoptimized for the purpose. Much of that data isn’t even directly observed by the advertisers in question. Companies have done deals for the right to rent a little piece of the webpage on sites of commercial interest, just enough to touch your browser and see who you are. These data brokers put you in some targeting segment—for example, “travel intenders” (i.e., people about to spend money on hotels)—and then resell you as “third-party data.” Since everyone has a pseudonym for you via your Web browser, and that browser is known to Facebook, Google, and everyone else, that data can be used to target you. This is all anonymous (in the sense of Facebook data never leaking out), but it’s everything you do online. All of it is more spice in the targeting sausage going through the advertising meat grinder, and is trafficked millions of times per second (whether you know or like it or not)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 425","","For someone who had spotted the resemblance between Goldman Sachs and Facebook within an hour of meeting the latter, I had forgotten my lessons learned at the former. When it came to monetization, Facebook had no interest in real innovation. It liked its faxes. Like any large company, Facebook would always aim to create monopoly pricing power and maintain information asymmetry, rather than drive true innovation. If Facebook played with the outside world, it always played with loaded dice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 451","","Google comes from the search world, in which a person simply types in a request for something. All Google has to do is get that person to the storefront. The value of a Google click is immense and expensive (which is why Google prints money). The value of a viewthrough to them is nil. In fact, it’s so nil that Google opts not to even show you an ad if your query doesn’t seem commercial, choosing to show you a blank billboard much of the time. Roughly half of Google queries don’t generate ads in the space next to them; test it yourself. To Google, the claims of viewthrough value seem bogus, an attempt to justify wasteful media spending. As a result, its ad server counts only clickthroughs. Its manual explicitly states, “Clicks trump impressions,” and Google drives that point home in every demo."
