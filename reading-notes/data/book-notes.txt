When each person sketches alone, he or she will have time for deep thought. When the whole team works in parallel, they’ll generate competing ideas, without the groupthink of a group brainstorm. You might call this method “work alone together.”"
"37.030";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 111";"Crazy 8s is a fast-paced exercise. Each person takes his or her strongest ideas and rapidly sketches eight variations in eight minutes. Crazy 8s forces you to push past your first reasonable solutions and make them better, or at least consider alternatives."

"37.032";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 123";"The entire sprint depends on getting good data in Friday’s test, so whoever takes charge of recruiting your customers should take the job seriously. Even though this recruiting happens behind the scenes, it’s as important as the team activities. For a sample screening survey and other online resources, take a look at thesprintbook.com"
"37.033";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 126";"By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and decide which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype."
"37.034";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 128";"We’ll evaluate solutions all at once, critique all at once, and then make a decision all at once."
"37.035";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 136";"That’s right—the proud inventor of the solution in the spotlight doesn’t get to speak up until the end of the critique. This unusual practice saves time, removes redundancy, and allows for the most honest discussion. (If the inventor pitched his or her idea, the rest of the team would have a harder time being critical or negative.)"
"37.036";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 142";"It’s important to note that this decision-making process isn’t perfect. Sometimes, Deciders screw up. Sometimes, good ideas don’t get selected (at least, not in the first sprint). But the “sticky decision”—if not perfect—is pretty good and very speedy. That speed helps with the sprint’s larger goal: getting real world data from Friday’s test. Ultimately, it will be that data that leads to the best decisions of all."
"37.037";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 149";"On Wednesday afternoon, you’ll answer those small questions and make a plan. Specifically, you’ll take the winning sketches and string them together into a storyboard. This will be similar to the three-panel storyboards you sketched on Tuesday, but it will be longer: about ten to fifteen panels, all tightly connected into one cohesive story."
"37.038";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 164";"On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. On Thursday, you’ll adopt a “fake it” philosophy to turn that storyboard into a realistic prototype. In the next chapters, we’ll explain the mindset, strategy, and tools that make it possible to build that prototype in just seven hours."
"37.039";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 166";"Thursday is about illusion. You’ve got an idea for a great solution. Instead of taking weeks, months, or, heck, even years building that solution, you’re going to fake it. In one day, you’ll make a prototype that appears real, just like that Old West façade. And on Friday, your customers—like a movie audience—will forget their surroundings and just react."
"37.040";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 166";"Sure, you could take a longer time to build a more perfect prototype—but doing so would only slow down the learning process. That may not matter if you’re on the right path, but let’s face it—not every idea is a winner. Whether you’re taking a risk on a bold idea, or you’re just not sure, it’s better to find out early. Wasting time on the wrong thing is a major bummer."
"37.041";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 169";"Once the illusion is broken, customers switch into feedback mode. They’ll try to be helpful and think up suggestions. In Friday’s test, customer reactions are solid gold, but their feedback is worth pennies on the dollar."
"37.042";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 170";"You want it to be as real as possible, while sticking to your one-day timeline. As our partner Daniel Burka says, the ideal prototype should be “Goldilocks quality.” If the quality is too low, people won’t believe the prototype is a real product. If the quality is too high, you’ll be working all night and you won’t finish. You need Goldilocks quality. Not too high, not too low, but just right."
"37.043";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 183";"Thursday is a bit different from other parts of the sprint. Every prototype is different, so there’s no exact step-by-step process we can share. But after making hundreds of our own prototypes, we’ve come up with four exercises that always set us on the right path: 1. Pick the right tools 2. Divide and conquer 3. Stitch it together 4. Do a trial run"
"37.044";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 184";"It doesn’t matter whether you work with designers, engineers, architects, marketers, or other creative professionals—or whether you run a store, provide client services, or build physical products. There’s a good chance that your team’s regular tools are not the right tools for prototyping."
"37.045";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 184";"We know it sounds crazy, but we’re 90 percent sure you should use Keynote to make your prototype. How can we suggest that when we don’t even know what you’re prototyping? Good question. Of course we can’t be completely sure—but in our 100+ sprints, Keynote has only come up short a handful of times."
"37.046";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 197";"Earlier in the week, you recruited and carefully selected participants for your test who match the profile of your target customer. Because you’ll be talking to the right people, we’re convinced you can trust what they say. And we’re also convinced that you can learn plenty from just five of them."
"37.047";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 198";"So Nielsen analyzed eighty-three of his own product studies.II He plotted how many problems were discovered after ten interviews, twenty interviews, and so on. The results were both consistent and surprising: 85 percent of the problems were observed after just five people."
"37.048";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 202";"This structured conversation helps the customer get comfortable, establishes some background, and ensures that the entire prototype is reviewed. Here’s how it goes: 1. A friendly welcome to start the interview 2. A series of general, open-ended context questions about the customer 3. Introduction to the prototype(s) 4. Detailed tasks to get the customer reacting to the prototype 5. A quick debrief to capture the customer’s overarching thoughts and impressions"
"37.049";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 223";"Maybe the best part about a sprint is that you can’t lose. If you test your prototype with customers, you’ll win the best prize of all—the chance to learn, in just five days, whether you’re on the right track with your ideas. The results don’t follow a neat template. You can have efficient failures that are good news, flawed successes that need more work, and many other outcomes."

Legendary consulting firm McKinsey & Company began running sprints, as did advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy. The sprint process is used at government agencies and nonprofits, as well as at major tech firms, at companies like Airbnb and Facebook."
"37.051";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 230";"Throughout the book, you learned a handful of unconventional ideas about how to work faster and smarter: • Instead of jumping right into solutions, take your time to map out the problem and agree on an initial target. Start slow so you can go fast. • Instead of shouting out ideas, work independently to make detailed sketches of possible solutions. Group brainstorming is broken, but there is a better way. • Instead of abstract debate and endless meetings, use voting and a Decider to make crisp decisions that reflect your team’s priorities. It’s the wisdom of the crowd without the groupthink. • Instead of getting all the details right before testing your solution, create a façade. Adopt the “prototype mindset” so you can learn quickly. • And instead of guessing and hoping you’re on the right track—all the while investing piles of money and months of time into your ideas—test your prototype with target customers and get their honest reactions."
"37.052";"Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days";"Page 255";"Q: Is Friday’s test a focus group? A: No. A “focus group” is ten or so customers discussing an idea all together, all at once. Focus groups are plagued by the worst of group dynamics: shy people not talking, loudmouths talking too much, sales pitches, and a group-formed opinion that doesn’t reflect anyone’s honest feelings. By comparison, Friday’s test features one-on-one interviews and observation of customer reactions. In these interviews, you can believe what you see."

Most companies are not those things. They are focused on the competitor, rather than the customer. They want to work on things that will pay dividends in two or three years, and if they don’t work in two or three years they will move on to something else. And they prefer to be close-followers rather than inventors, because it’s safer. So if you want to capture the truth about Amazon, that is why we are different. Very few companies have all of those three elements.”"

It wasn’t as if Jeff was coming up with something completely new.”"

In the auctions category, eBay already had an insurmountable advantage."
"18.005";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 1488";"The Amazon we know today, with all of its attributes and idiosyncrasies, is in many ways a product of the obstacles Bezos and Amazon navigated during the dot-com crash, a response to the widespread lack of faith in the company and its leadership."

"18.007";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 1627";"Bezos was obsessed with the customer experience, and anyone who didn’t have the same single-minded focus or who he felt wasn’t demonstrating a capacity for thinking big bore the brunt of his considerable temper."

"18.012";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 2542";"Up until that time, Amazon employees had been using Microsoft’s PowerPoint and Excel spreadsheet software to present their ideas in meetings. Bezos believed that method concealed lazy thinking."
"18.013";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 2546";"Bezos announced that employees could no longer use such corporate crutches and would have to write their presentations in prose, in what he called narratives."
"18.014";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 2557";"Bezos refined the formula even further. Every time a new feature or product was proposed, he decreed that the narrative should take the shape of a mock press release. The goal was to get employees to distill a pitch into its purest essence, to start from something the customer might see—the public announcement—and work backward. Bezos didn’t believe anyone could make a good decision about a feature or a product without knowing precisely how it would be communicated to the world—and what the hallowed customer would make of it."
"18.015";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 2595";"That was a typical interaction with Jeff. He had this unbelievable ability to be incredibly intelligent about things he had nothing to do with, and he was totally ruthless about communicating it.”"

"18.021";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 3393";"Bezos ultimately concluded that if Amazon was to continue to thrive as a bookseller in a new digital age, it must own the e-book business in the same way that Apple controlled the music business. “It is far better to cannibalize yourself than have someone else do it,” said Diego Piacentini in a speech at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business a few years later. “We didn’t want to be Kodak.” The reference was to the century-old photography giant whose engineers had invented digital cameras in the 1970s but whose profit margins were so healthy that its executives couldn’t bear to risk it all on an unproven venture in a less profitable frontier."
"18.022";"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon";"Location 3431";"By that time, Bezos and his executives had devoured and raptly discussed another book that would significantly affect the company’s strategy: The Innovator’s Dilemma, by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen. Christensen wrote that great companies fail not because they want to avoid disruptive change but because they are reluctant to embrace promising new markets that might undermine their traditional businesses and that do not appear to satisfy their short-term growth requirements."

He believed that if Amazon didn’t lead the world into the age of digital reading, then Apple or Google would. When Kessel asked Bezos what his deadline was on developing the company’s first piece of hardware, an electronic reading device, Bezos told him, “You are basically already late.”"

A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.”"

Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught."
"36.002";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 8";"This is a book for entrepreneurs and the people who hold them accountable. The five principles of the Lean Startup, which inform all three parts of this book, are as follows:"
"36.003";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 8";"Entrepreneurs are everywhere. You don’t have to work in a garage to be in a startup. The concept of entrepreneurship includes anyone who works within my definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. That means entrepreneurs are everywhere and the Lean Startup approach can work in any size company, even a very large enterprise, in any sector or industry. 2. Entrepreneurship is management. A startup is an institution, not just a product, and so it requires a new kind of management specifically geared to its context of extreme uncertainty. In fact, as I will argue later, I believe “entrepreneur” should be considered a job title in all modern companies that depend on innovation for their future growth. 3. Validated learning. Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision. 4. Build-Measure-Learn. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. 5. Innovation accounting. To improve entrepreneurial outcomes and hold innovators accountable, we need to focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting designed for startups—and the people who hold them accountable."
"36.004";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 18";"Lean thinking is radically altering the way supply chains and production systems are run. Among its tenets are drawing on the knowledge and creativity of individual workers, the shrinking of batch sizes, just-in-time production and inventory control, and an acceleration of cycle times."
"36.005";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 20";"The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible. In other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight, a huge vision, and great ambition, all at the same time."
"36.006";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 26";"Entrepreneurs who operate inside an established organization sometimes are called “intrapreneurs” because of the special circumstances that attend building a startup within a larger company. As I have applied Lean Startup ideas in an ever-widening variety of companies and industries, I have come to believe that intrapreneurs have much more in common with the rest of the community of entrepreneurs than most people believe. Thus, when I use the term entrepreneur, I am referring to the whole startup ecosystem regardless of company size, sector, or stage of development."
"36.007";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 27";"A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."
"36.008";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 34";"The amount of time a company can count on holding on to market leadership to exploit its earlier innovations is shrinking, and this creates an imperative for even the most entrenched companies to invest in innovation. In fact, I believe a company’s only sustainable path to long-term economic growth is to build an “innovation factory” that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis."
"36.009";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 38";"Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere."
"36.010";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 39";"Like most communication networks, IM is thought to follow Metcalfe’s law: the value of a network as a whole is proportional to the square of the number of participants."
"36.011";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 48";"Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste."
"36.012";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 49";"I’ve come to believe that learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this validated learning because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics. As we’ve seen, it’s easy to kid yourself about what you think customers want. It’s also easy to learn things that are completely irrelevant. Thus, validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers."
"36.013";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 50";"We adopted the view that our job was to find a synthesis between our vision and what customers would accept; it wasn’t to capitulate to what customers thought they wanted or to tell customers what they ought to want."
"36.014";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 55";"Instead, the way forward is to learn to see every startup in any industry as a grand experiment. The question is not “Can this product be built?” In the modern economy, almost any product that can be imagined can be built. The more pertinent questions are “Should this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?” To answer those questions, we need a method for systematically breaking down a business plan into its component parts and testing each part empirically."
"36.015";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 55";"we need the scientific method. In the Lean Startup model, every product, every feature, every marketing campaign—everything a startup does—is understood to be"

"36.018";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 61";"For the growth hypothesis, which tests how new customers will discover a product or service, we can do a similar analysis."
"36.019";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 75";"As we saw in Part One, the products a startup builds are really experiments; the learning about how to build a sustainable business is the outcome of those experiments."
"36.020";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 76";"The truth is that none of these activities by itself is of paramount importance. Instead, we need to focus our energies on minimizing the total time through this feedback loop. This is the essence of steering a startup and is the subject of Part Two"

The two most important assumptions are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. These give rise to tuning variables that control a startup’s engine of growth. Each iteration of a startup is an attempt to rev this engine to see if it will turn. Once it is running, the process repeats, shifting into higher and higher gears."
"36.022";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 77";"The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. The minimum viable product lacks many features that may prove essential later on. However, in some ways, creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact. For example, it is inadequate to build a prototype that is evaluated solely for internal quality by engineers and designers. We also need to get it in front of potential customers to gauge their reactions."
"36.023";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 78";"Although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: we figure out what we need to learn, use innovation accounting to figure out what we need to measure to know if we are gaining validated learning, and then figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement."
"36.024";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 84";"What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly."
"36.025";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 86";"The importance of basing strategic decisions on firsthand understanding of customers is one of the core principles that underlies the Toyota Production System. At Toyota, this goes by the Japanese term genchi gembutsu, which is one of the most important phrases in the lean manufacturing vocabulary. In English, it is usually translated as a directive to “go and see for yourself” so that business decisions can be based on deep firsthand knowledge."
"36.026";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 91";"The problem with most entrepreneurs’ plans is generally not that they don’t follow sound strategic principles but that the facts upon which they are based are wrong. Unfortunately, most of these errors cannot be detected at the whiteboard because they depend on the subtle interactions between products and customers."
"36.027";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 93";"A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.3 It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort."
"36.028";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 93";"Contrary to traditional product development, which usually involves a long, thoughtful incubation period and strives for product perfection, the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it. Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses."
"36.029";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 95";"Deciding exactly how complex an MVP needs to be cannot be done formulaically. It requires judgment. Luckily, this judgment is not difficult to develop: most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify."
"36.030";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 96";"The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time."
"36.031";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 102";"Before long, they had built a substantial service offering, first in the Austin area and eventually nationwide. But along the way, their product development team was always focused on scaling something that was working rather than trying to invent something that might work in the future. As a result, their development efforts involved far less waste than is typical for a venture of this kind."
"36.032";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 105";"Because of the short time line, none of the prototypes involved advanced technology. Instead, they were MVPs designed to test a more important question: what would be required to get customers to engage with the product and tell their friends about it?"
"36.033";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 107";"we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is. Even a “low-quality” MVP can act in service of building a great high-quality product."
"36.034";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 110";"As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek."
"36.035";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 111";"The reason to build a new team to pursue an idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that’s true, it makes no difference what the competition knows. If it’s not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy won’t fix them."
"36.036";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 113";"The solution to this problem resides at the heart of the Lean Startup model. We all need a disciplined, systematic approach to figuring out if we’re making progress and discovering if we’re actually achieving validated learning. I call this system innovation accounting, an alternative to traditional accounting designed specifically for startups."
"36.037";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 114";"A startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2) devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan."
"36.038";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 116";"Innovation accounting enables startups to prove objectively that they are learning how to grow a sustainable business. Innovation accounting begins by turning the leap-of-faith assumptions discussed in Chapter 5 into a quantitative financial model. Every business plan has some kind of model associated with it, even if it’s written on the back of a napkin. That model provides assumptions about what the business will look like at a successful point in the future."
"36.039";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 128";"Companies of any size that have a working engine of growth can come to rely on the wrong kind of metrics to guide their actions."
"36.040";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 130";"Innovation accounting will not work if a startup is being misled by these kinds of vanity metrics: gross number of customers and so on. The alternative is the kind of metrics we use to judge our business and our learning milestones, what I call actionable metrics"
"36.041";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 135";"because Grockit was using the wrong kinds of metrics, the startup was not genuinely improving."
"36.042";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 140";"Most important, teams working in this system begin to measure their productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of the production of new features."
"36.043";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 144";"Actionable metrics are the antidote to this problem. When cause and effect is clearly understood, people are better able to learn from their actions. Human beings are innately talented learners when given a clear and objective assessment."
"36.044";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 148";"Only 5 percent of entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the whiteboard strategizing, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other 95 percent is the gritty work that is measured by innovation accounting: product prioritization decisions, deciding which customers to target or listen to, and having the courage to subject a grand vision to constant testing and feedback."
"36.045";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 149";"are we making sufficient progress to believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth."
"36.046";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 153";"David faced the difficult challenge of deciding whether to pivot or persevere. This is one of the hardest decisions entrepreneurs face. The goal of creating learning milestones is not to make the decision easy; it is to make sure that there is relevant data in the room when it comes time to decide."
"36.047";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 154";"A pivot requires that we keep one foot rooted in what we’ve learned so far, while making a fundamental change in strategy in order to seek even greater validated learning."
"36.048";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 160";"The true measure of runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy. Measuring runway through the lens of pivots rather than that of time suggests another way to extend that runway: get to each pivot faster. In other words, the startup has to find ways to achieve the same amount of validated learning at lower cost or in a shorter time. All the techniques in the Lean Startup model that have been discussed so far have this as their overarching goal."
"36.049";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 172";"The word pivot sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for change. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth."
"36.050";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 181";"The critical first question for any lean transformation is: which activities create value and which are a form of waste? Once you understand this distinction, you can begin using lean techniques to drive out waste and increase the efficiency of the value-creating activities."
"36.051";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 185";"The small-batch approach produces a finished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach must deliver all the products at once, at the end. Imagine what this might look like if the time horizon was hours, days, or weeks. What if it turns out that the customers have decided they don’t want the product? Which process would allow a company to find this out sooner?"
"36.052";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 188";"What if it turns out that the customer doesn’t want the product we’re building? Although this is never good news for an entrepreneur, finding out sooner is much better than finding out later. Working in small batches ensures that a startup can minimize the expenditure of time, money, and effort that ultimately turns out to have been wasted."
"36.053";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 201";"Our goal in building products is to be able to run experiments that will help us learn how to build a sustainable business. Thus, the right way to think about the product development process in a Lean Startup is that it is responding to pull requests in the form of experiments that need to be run."
"36.054";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 221";"A startup can evaluate whether it is getting closer to product/market fit as it tunes its engine by evaluating each trip through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop using innovation accounting. What really matters is not the raw numbers or vanity metrics but the direction and degree of progress."
"36.055";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 227";"This process of orientation was subject to constant experimentation and revision so that it grew more effective—and less burdensome—over time.

"36.056";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 227";"you cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing) quality problems now, the resulting defects will slow you down later. Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints, all of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources."
"36.057";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 250";"The focus of each team is iterating with customers as rapidly as possible, running experiments, and then using validated learning to make real-time investment decisions about what to work on. As a result, whereas they used to have five major “branches” of QuickBooks that merged features at the time of the launch, now there are twenty to twenty-five branches. This allows for a much larger set of experiments. Each team works on a new feature for approximately six weeks end to end, testing it with real customers throughout the process."
"36.058";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 253";"Internal or external, in my experience startup teams require three structural attributes: scarce but secure resources, independent authority to develop their business, and a personal stake in the outcome."
"36.059";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 261";"My suggested solution is to create a sandbox for innovation that will contain the impact of the new innovation but not constrain the methods of the startup team."
"36.060";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 267";"entrepreneurship should be considered a viable career path for innovators inside large organizations. Managers who can lead teams by using the Lean Startup methodology should not have to leave the company to reap the rewards of their skills or have to pretend to fit into the rigid hierarchies of established functional departments. Instead, they should have a business card that says simply"
"36.061";"The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses";"Page 271";"Ultimately, the Lean Startup is a framework, not a blueprint of steps to follow. It is designed to be adapted to the conditions of each specific company. Rather than copy what others have done, techniques such as the Five Whys allow you to build something that is perfectly suited to your company."
